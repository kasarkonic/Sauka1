For control over modbus RTU, you need to configure drive:
Modbus address [ADD]
Do not forget to switch off and on the drive when any of communication setting is changed in order to be applied.

FR1 [freq reference channel 1] = Modbus RTU

The rest is optional according to your preferences.



To control the drive (to send commands and target speed), it is necessary to write value into:
CMD register (@ 8501)
LFR (@8502) or LFRD (@8602).
LFR is register for target velocity in Hz and LFRD in rpm. You can write into one of them only, not to both.

To read drive state, read:
ETA (@3201) state register
RFR (@3202) actual motor speed in Hz



If ATV is configured for combined (target speed and commands always from the same channel) CHCF=combined or when ATV is configured from separate ((target speed and commands may come from different channels), CHCF=separate
then drive is controlled according to CIA402 diagram.

Diagram is shown in modbus manual or in my video.

Sequence for start:
CMD=6
CMD=7
CMD=15
Sequence for STOP
CMD=7 (or CMD=6)

Forward or reverse is done by target speed in LFR or LFRD. Positive value = forward speed, negative value = reverse speed.

In IO mode (CHCF=IO profile) the CMD register must be written by same values like terminals. e.g. bit 0 = same behavior like DI1 input.
Bit 1 in CMD = same behavior like DI2, end so on.
So start sequence is IO mode:
CMD=1
ST0P sequence in IO mode:
CMD=0
For reverse and reset, see example from modus manual, page attached.


For reading and writing these 4 variables (ETA+RFR and CMD+LFR), we recommend to use read/write multiple registers modbus code. This telegram goes directly to ATV io scanner table and no need for extra setting.
Scanner table can be easy configured in somove, so if you need to add more variables, it is very easy

All that i explained here is also commented in my video
